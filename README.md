## Tech

### CSS Framework - [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/)

We used Materialize to create various elements in our application. A variety of Materialize classes were used to create the following elements:

- The form on the landing page was made using a combination of inputs, select elements, checkboxes, and buttons.
- The navigation bar using the same elements as the form as well as a multiple select dropdown.
- The search results cards using the Materialize card elements.
- The modal on the search results page and the wishlist page was created using the Materialize modal element and accompanying JavaScript. We also added an input box and a date picker from Materialize to the modals.
